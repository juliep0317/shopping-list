Activity: 4.1: Task Application

Objective: Activity 4.1 of the Essentials Javascript course was to create a task list application using DOM manipulation in JavaScript.  

The task application allows the user to managed their list of tasks by adding, crossing off the done tasks, and deleting the finished one off their list. 

For my mini task application project, I decided to create a shopping list that was responsive on all devices, so it is handy and easy accessible on your phone while you are doing the weekly food shop. 

Features

Sophistcated and user friendly design.

Smooth transition of tasks being adding, crossed off and removed.
